# Color Theory API
This repository contains the JavaScript API for a color scheme generator.
Simply import the api.js file in a script tag and use the colorScheme(imageSrc) function, where imageSrc is a link to a local image, to get two color schemes that are representative of the image. This function will store the color schemes in the global dark and light JavaScript arrays. Use the data returned by this API in any way you like. Of course, this API can be tinkered with to acclimate to your needs.
